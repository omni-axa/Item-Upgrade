This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger. Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was invulnerable to fire, cold or acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.

More recently, <CHARNAME> arranged for Aeger's Hide to be improved with additional enchantments. It now provides a greater resistance to physical blows and elemental attacks.

@151 = ~Throwing Spear +3
One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end. When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel. This spear trembles from the powerful magic used in its creation.

Unlike almost every other spear you have encountered, this spear can be thrown. It was forged for <CHARNAME> with the help of a magical Rogue Stone. When thrown, the spear immediately returns to the hand of the wielder. (The spear may also be used as a melee weapon: select the second item ability to do so.)

This graceful spear is carved to resemble the elongated horn of the unicorn. Wielders of this spear are immune to charm and hold spells, just as a unicorn might be. Whether the horn is or isn't an actual unicorn horn is the subject of much debate.

The original Unicorn Spear was reforged by <CHARNAME> to serve as a ranged weapon. When thrown, the spear immediately returns to the hand of the wielder. The immediacy of the return may explain how a throwing weapon can confer continuous effects on its wielder. Or maybe it's just magic.

After <CHARNAME> "liberated" the Impaler from the Sahuagin City-of-Caverns <PRO_HESHE> later had it reforged into a ranged weapon. When thrown, the spear immediately returns to the hand of the wielder. (The spear may also be used as a melee weapon: select the second item ability to do so.)

Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood", the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil. Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, a feature that would fade if the staff were set aside. He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more. The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters. Rushing forward in hopes of ending his influence, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

Recently the Staff was re-enchanted by <CHARNAME> to give it slightly better melee abilities.

@160 = ~Celestial Fury +5~
@161 = ~Celestial Fury +5
To enchant a katana is no simple process. At least, that's what <CHARNAME> thought before <PRO_HESHE> first had it attempted on <PRO_HISHER> behalf. In reality, the most difficult part of reforging the already-godlike katana known as Celestial Fury was gathering the myriad ingredients required. Celestial Fury has served <CHARNAME> well since it was taken from the kensai Koshi in the Temple District of Athkatla. Its provenance before that point is as follows:

Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected wizards, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.

Yet Daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.

Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

Celestial Fury is a katana of excellent construction -- a flexible but unbreakable blade of razor sharpness, a hilt covered with comfortable leather, and a huge pearl fixed at its end. The magical characters for Celestial Fury are inscribed on the blade, which glows pale violet and crackles with electricity when drawn. The sword is sheathed in a scabbard of dragon hide, the slate-grey scales of which constantly flash with streaks of silver, blue, and violet.

Lilarcor is not quite as lovable (or annoying, depending on your viewpoint) as it was before <CHARNAME> had it upgraded. When the Mind Flayer Control Circlet was embedded in its hilt, Lilarcor seemed to lose the ability to consciously converse with those nearby and was reduced to making occasional quips. However, Lilarcor's peculiar intelligence (or lack thereof) now serves as a boon (or a blight) to the wielder: the one holding Lilarcor cannot have its intelligence adjusted for any reason. This protects against the intelligence drain associated with the Illithid and the beneficial effects of a potion of Genius.

@176 = ~Holy Buckler of Amaunator +2~
@177 = ~Holy Buckler of Amaunator +2
<CHARNAME> had a holy symbol of Amaunator, the long-dead Sun God, forged into this buckler. It is now a potent barrier against those that would stalk the night and drain the life of the living.

@178 = ~Gloves of the Master Thief~
@179 = ~Gloves of the Master Thief: Twelve Fingers
<CHARNAME> had these gloves formed from a number of more mundane items that benefit the rogue. When these gloves are worn by a thief, each glove appears to have an extra magical finger that aids the fortune-hunter in performing their unique skills. In addition, the gloves are stylish. They look almost ... gnomish in design.

@180 = ~Amulet of Ilmater~
@181 = ~Amulet of Ilmater
This amulet combines the defensive power of an Amulet of Protection, a Periapt of Proof against Poison, the Necklace of Form Stability and the Amulet of Spell Warding to provide potent protection upon its wearer. In addition, the Amulet holds a minor blessing from the long-suffering Ilmater. The amulet was commissioned by <CHARNAME>. 

STATISTICS:

Wearer is Immune to Poison

Armor Class Bonus:  1
Saving Throw Bonus:  3~

@182 = ~Water's Talon +4~
@183 = ~Water's Talon +4
The blade of this weapon seems to shimmer, revealing a fluid, razor-sharp edge shaped somewhat like the talon of a bird of prey. Water's Talon was commissioned by <CHARNAME> and holds vast power over damaging liquids. Each hit sucks some of the life out of the target and confers it to the wielder.  In addition, the water-like edge of the blade is forever envenomed. Much like one of its predecessors, Water's Talon provides immunity to charm. In addition, however, its mastery over water protects the user from the harmful effects of Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting. Most uniquely, the liquid nature of the blade allows it to extend and splash during combat, improving the strike range granted by the weapon to a range beyond that of most two-handed swords. This allows the wielder to make otherwise-impossible attacks from the back rows of a formation or try for daring hit-and-run tactics, counting on the poison from the first hit to disable foes.

STATISTICS:

Equipped Abilities: Wielder immune to charm, domination and horrid wilting spells
Special Abilities: Each hit raises the wielder's maximum hit points by 2 for 3 minutes
Special Properties: Extended Strike Range

@184 = ~Azuredge +4~
@185 = ~Azuredge +4
The already potent undead-bane Azuredge was further enhanced by <CHARNAME> when <PRO_HESHE> had it coated with a veneer of pure illithium. The axe first forged by Gulen Rockfire still returns to its wielder's hand when thrown and still smites undead with a holy fervor, but now it also protects the wielder from the level-draining assaults of the more powerful graveborn. On a more decorative note, the illithium seems to have shifted the color of the weapon slightly away from its namesake. 

STATISTICS

STATISTICS:

@190 = ~Improved Kitthix Figurine~
@191 = ~Improved Kitthix Figurine
Reforged by <CHARNAME> to summon forth an even more powerful spider, the Kitthix figurine is no longer the last-ditch delaying tactic it once was. Gone are the days when Kitthix would be instructed to throw itself in front of a vastly superior foe in the hopes of momentarily distracting it. Kitthix's web-spinning and poisoning abilities have been upgraded, and the spider itself is less likely to be crushed by every passing foe.

STATISTICS:

Summons a phasing sword spider named Kitthix for 2400 seconds, once each day. The spider can Phase to far-away foes. Kitthix's attack webs and poisons its foes if they fail various saving throws.~

@123472 = ~Ah, the Hallowed Redeemer. A holy blade, if a minor one by local standards. With a Demon Heart and five scrolls that Dispel Magic I could reforge it into something stronger still.

@123475 = ~Yes, that's quite a knife you have there. I could forge Bone Blade and Pixie Prick together using four potions of Master Thievery as reagents and make a truly wicked blade for a thief. Would it be worth 15,000 gold to you?~

@123497 = ~Can Chaos and Entropy be improved?~
@123498 = ~Ah, you want me to upgrade Planar weapons. Very dangerous work, that. Hmmm, let's see. If you don't mind sacrificing the swords of Ilbratha and Arbane, I can reforge Haer'Dalis' short swords so that they will inflict more damage and gain some spell-like powers. It will cost you 25,000 in gold, plus a Rogue Stone and scrolls of Chaos and Greater Malison. Are ye interested?~

@123499 = ~Can you forge me some elven chain?~
@1234100 = ~Yes, I might forge together a suit of Sylvan Chain with the scales of a beast of the dread flame. With three gems of Andar and 3 Fire Agates to contain the inferno and 25,000 for reagents and labor, I could make ye a mighty powerful suit. Interested?~

@5678947 = ~Still, you gots nice taste in footwear. Very good recipe for Boots of the Hornet, take your Boots of Speed and Avoidance and make you real hard to hit with arrows. Better than poke in the eye with sharp stick, or bolt, or stone, or dart... you gets the idea. Recipe costs 20,000 gold and Rogue Stone, which does not grow on most trees. Yes?~

@567848 = ~Oooooohhhh... you gots some scary sticks! Hee hee hee! You must have druid friend or something. Always have to have sticks for them. You think trees the sticks came from are mad?~ [FWCESP08]
@5678948 = ~Maybe you got acid stick Blackblood and Gnasher, stick that SOMEBODY forgot to polish. Have recipe for Pitchwife, so now youse can give bad guys splinters that BUUUUUURN! Low low price of 15,000 gold. Unless you want Cespenar to get out sandpaper instead.~

@567849 = ~Ouch! How come all your clubses be so spikey? Cespenar think he has cheesecloth somewhere to help with that...~ [FWCESP09]
@5678949 = ~Or maybe you just want better club? Can take Bone Club and Gnashers and make Fulcrum. Hurts people who don't like "the balance." Cespenar try to stay away from politics, though, so he just takes 15,000 gold and makes the club and forgets about it, okay?~

@567850 = ~Cespenar never understand why clerics allowed to make your head a bloody pulp but can't use butter knife. Weeeeeeeeeird.~ [FWCESP10]
@5678950 = ~Anyway, you got good Skullcrusher mace. Cespenar can make much better with Finger of Death scroll, CURSED potion of healing (good cocktail mixer!) and 15,000 gold. And 3 clothespins from Matron Mother's undies drawer. Cespenar kidding about that part.~

// newby

@567851 = ~Hrrrrruuuhhh... hrrrruuuuhhh... hyyyyaaaaaaahhhhh! Oooh, this bow hard to bend! Cespenar would offer to shoot arrow off the Great One's head, but remember what happened when missed apple and hit Bhaal's nose. Cespenar not able to sit down for a tenday!~ [FWCESP11]
@5678951 = ~You gots a nice bow, but can make much better with recipe for Teleomortis. Arrows appear in your hand, amazes your friends and enemieses. Needs lots of important materials: Gesen String or Gond String, four Laeral's Tears and Potion of Power for brewing, though.~

@567854 = ~Oooh! Very sharp suits. Careful, mister, Cespenar not dusted yet today... if you sneeze, face may freeze that way. Tee hee hee! You know, some people say that Valygar is a bad mother... shut Cespenar's mouth? Cespenar just talking about Valygar!~ [FWCESP12]
@5678954 = ~Can do a lot with two good suits, can make one really good suit! Lots of protections from most bad things like fire and acid! No need for matching cufflinks, just give Cespenar 10,000 gold and Scroll of Protection from Magic.~

@567855 = ~Cespenar once have smoking jacket... was gift from very good friend, got lost at cleaners. You maybe have somethings to do with it? This lookings very familiar...~ [FWCESP13]
// @5678955 = ~Oh, is just Robe of Archmage Peoples. Good recipe so name not be so silly. Cespenar needs Ring of Protection +1, Scrolls of Spirit Armor and Contingency and 20,000 gold. Cast more spells, be like REAL ARCHMAGE!~
@56789955 = ~Oh, is just Robe of Archmage Peoples. Good recipe so name not be so silly. Cespenar needs Cloak of Protection +1, Scrolls of Spirit Armor and Contingency and 20,000 gold. Cast more spells, be like REAL ARCHMAGE!~

@567859 = ~You ever not have pot to piss in? Youse know that saying? Cespenar suggest you use helmet, then. Someone else's helmet.~ [FWCESP14]
@5678959 = ~If you does have extra pots, maybe Cespenar combine your big head pots for you! Good recipe smushes Helm of Defense and Helm of Charm Protection together. Need 4 pearls and 10,000 gold. Sounds good, yes?~

@567860 = ~Oooh! Cespenar could use for mixing bowl, if you no need this helmet anymore.~ [FWCESP15]
@5678960 = ~How about recipe of Tower of Iron Will? Use Helm of Charm Protection, two Brine Love Juices potions from Mind Flayers (don't tell Cespenar how you gots them) and 10,000 gold. Keeps big people's heads even safer.~

@567861 = ~You maybe want this hung on the wall? Most peoples don't want fireplace in Hell but maybe we can get one and make into floor rug.~ [FWCESP16]
@5678961 = ~Or maybe you just want made shinier. Take Aeger's Hide, Scroll of Protection from the Elements, and 15,000 gold, and make stronger and make weather stuff hurt less. Cespenar never allowed to REALLY be creative.~

@567862 = ~How you get orange goody two-shoes armor, anyway? Armor out in sun too long? Tee hee hee...~ [FWCESP17]
@5678962 = ~Maybe Cespenar can make better by smelting down with Armor of the Hart and throwing in 20,000 gold. Could be less but Cespenar had to discontinue goody two-shoes discount, bad for reputation.~

@567863 = ~You still wearing big bug on shoulders? You meets lots of new peoples that way?~ [FWCESP18]
@5678963 = ~You give Cespenar both kinds of Protection From Acid scrolls and 5,000 gold and Cespenar make bug work harder. Even shoot acid arrows at peoples!~

@567864 = ~Awww, this is most adorable shield Cespenar ever see! Can maybe use for serving tray when company comes over?~ [FWCESP19]
@5678964 = ~Hard to make good thing better, but if you gots two Mind Flayer brine drinks, weird control circles from same octopus-heads, and beljuril gem and 10,000 gold, Cespenar make you immune to Psionics, too.~

@567865 = ~This reminds Cespenar of veeeeery long toothpick. Open wide, Cespenar is good servant, even clean your molars! Tee hee hee!~ [FWCESP20]
@5678965 = ~How come you keep glued to your hand? Afraid it never comes back? Simple recipe: 10,000 gold and rogue stone, and spear will always come back if you throw it a looooooong way.~

@567866 = ~What is this? Big lollipop on a stick? How come Cespenar never gets a lick?~ [FWCESP21]
@5678966 = ~Oh, is unicorn horn. And pointy, too. Why don't youse start throwing this spear? Just give Cespenar Rogue Stone and 10,000 gold and you makes out like a wild spear-chucking bandit!~

@567867 = ~You likes fishing? Maybe go fishing for big whale with this. Then you needs place to tie it, but that not Cespenar's problem.~ [FWCESP22]
@5678967 = ~Make Impaler hurt so good from a very long way away. Needs just 15,000 gold and Rogue Stone. I really uses those things, I don't just ask for them for fun. Careful when spear comes back...if you miss, it will HURT! Ow!~

@567868 = ~Nice big staff. Is bark worse than its bite? Tee hee hee...~ [FWCESP23]
@5678968 = ~Cespenar can swing great new recipe for new Staff of the Woodlands. You gives Cespenar Ring of Protection +1, Ring of Animal Friendship and 20,000 gold, and we gets new staff that recharges and even does big nasties when you hit peoples!~

@567869 = ~Ooooh! You got shiniest of all shiny longswords! I bet you killed a vampire or two with this baby! En garde, bloodsuckers! Cespenar will smite thee!~ [FWCESP24]
@5678969 = ~Maybe you like better Daystar? You gots to give me good stuff, like four scrolls of Protection from Undead, two vials of elven holy water, two star sapphires and 15,000 gold, but Cespenar can hardly steer the Great One wrong! You gets more Sunrays and Protection from Evil. Needs must I begin?~

@567870 = ~Oh, most honorable Great One-san! Can youse believe that Celestial Fury not looking so good anymore?~ [FWCESP25]
@5678970 = ~Cespenar have nice quick recipe to fix that! Well, is maybe not so quick. You gots Wand of Lightning? How about spare demon heart? Stiiiinky, I know, but they comes in handy for strangest things. Oh, and 20,000 gold be needed as well.~

@567871 = ~You got the littlest paladin goody two-shoes? Cespenar got storybook in his attic that mention something like that.~ [FWCESP26]
@5678971 = ~Can make sword much better. Special discount for not so big peoples, just need to think good thoughts and give Cespenar 15,000 gold! You not find better deal this side of Limbo!~

@567872 = ~Cespenar very very impressed to have goody two-shoes peoples with the Great One! You maybe want to still be using signature weapon to help the Great One?~ [FWCESP27]
@5678972 = ~Cespenar knows Priest of Torm who will re-Hallow the Redeemer and give neatness like dispelling magic and silencing other peoples. Need extra demon heart (Cespenar fresh out), five scrolls of Dispel Magic and 15,000 gold, plus heart of gold. Would be less money, but Cespenar have to pay per-use license on recipe to goody two-shoes lawyer peoples. They strongarm poor Cespenar.~

@567873 = ~Oh boy! More serving platters! Cespenar running out of table settings for Great One's banquets!~ [FWCESP28]
@5678973 = ~Wait... I knows recipe for big serving platters shield things. Take Delryn Family Shield and Saving Grace platter, and use 15,000 gold to make Delryn Shield protect more! Or we just keeps extra trays for company.~

@567874 = ~What? You no like talking sword? What if you gets buried in deep dark hole and only gots sword to talk to? You be grateful, then!~ [FWCESP29]
@5678974 = ~But, hmmmm, Cespenar sees Mind Flayer Control Circlet, can use to make Lilarcor stronger, keep nasty mind flayers from suckings your brains out through straw, too! And Larry can't talk to youse no more. It would be sad, and it woulds costs you 20,000 gold, too.~

@567875 = ~You ever think of making love, not war? You sure gots lots of knives here... ~ [FWCESP30]
@5678975 = ~Ahhhh, Cespenar have good idea! Make good dagger for sneaky peoples. Take Bone Blade and Pixie Prick and make dagger of very very good backstabbing and sleepiness! Needs must add four potions of Master Thievery and pay 15,000 gold, but then enemies never know what hit them, POW!~

// ....

@567879 = ~Oooh, someone talk you into Ammunition of Plenty? Is like bad penny... guess Cespenar needs must throw this in river again, this time with bigger weight attached!~ [FWCESP31]
@5678979 = ~Or maybe we try something different this time and use new recipe. You gots 40 +3 missiles and 40,000 gold and then we make Ammunitions of Plenty +3. Think of all the money you be saving on missiles! Unless youse invested in fancy long-term bonds, then youse probably make out even better.~


@567880 = ~Yes, upgrade the Quiver.~
@567881 = ~Yes, upgrade the Case.~
@567882 = ~Yes, upgrade the Bag.~

@567883 = ~Looks like big peoples on clothes hanger. Hello, big peoples! Wave to Cespenar, you gets worn around now by the Great One!~ [FWCESP32]
@5678983 = ~Cespenar no taxidermist but can take Human Flesh and combine with Soulstone and Scroll of Protection from Magic and 20,000 gold and make much shinier. Make you healthier and stronger. Can't say same for big peoples you wearing.~

@567884 = ~Where you find this? Bhaal look all over for this, never find it! Him wanted to hang over doorway as decoration... Cespenar talk him into roses, but that was soooooome fight...~ [FWCESP33]
@5678984 = ~Very very devious recipe for Soul Reaver. Take Heart of the Damned and ultimate sword of goody two-shoesness and 20,000 gold, make Soul Reaver super-super deadly! When goody two-shoes come asking, you no tell them it was Cespenar's idea!~

@567885 = ~Ooh, shiny symbol of old Sun God! Amaunator and Bhaal never really got along. Old dispute involving demons, sunlight and this one blessed goat. Very sad story. After goat died, Ammy never came back over for tea.~ [FWCESP34]
@5678985 = ~Anyway, can puts holy symbol into buckler. Add one Sunstone Gem for each finger and 10,000 gold, make shiny shield for scaring undead nasties. You want?~

@567886 = ~Thiefy sneakings, I see. Youse going to pick Cespenar's pockets? Wait! Cespenar has no pockets. Ha! Don't feel bad. I'm sure there will be lots of baddies for you to loot later.~ [FWCESP35]
@5678986 = ~In the mean-time, I have a recipe for thiefy accesories. Quite the fashion plate: gloveses of pick pocketing and defense, rings of danger senses and lock picking, two rings of protection. With 5,000 gold I can make one big shiny one.~

@567887 = ~Ah, sparkly jewels you haves. Very poor color coordination, however.  Perhaps Cespenar can help you with that later. Some mauve would really bring out your eyes? No?~ [FWCESP36]
@5678987 = ~Anyway, Cespenar can smash together two Amulets of Protection, a Periapt of Proof against Poison, a Necklace of Form Stability and an Amulet of Spell Warding. That's a lot of chains an jewels! Obtain minor blessing from good friend Ilmater (for some reason, Ilmater have soft-spot for poor Cespenar) and presto! Youse wants for 10,000 gold?~

@567888 = ~Swish-swash! Blade of water would be much more fun than just splashing around. Youse a fencer, perhaps? Cespenar have recipe that work very well for speedy lunges.~ [FWCESP37]
@5678988 = ~With Water's Edge, Rashad's Talon and Adjatha the Drinker, can make big water-themed sword. Not so big, really, but still very nice. Hope you likes poison! Have 15,000 gold for the job?~

@567889 = ~Oooh, shiny axe that kills evil things. You trying to kill Cespenar? Oh wait, only works on undead, not demons. Very scary for a moment. Cespenar sees life pass before eyes: too much bowing, not enough scraping. Must rectify.~ [FWCESP38]
@5678989 = ~Anyway, pink not really your color. Could apply coating of illithium to Azuredge, make it a much more refined purple. Also grant some extra undead-smiting powers and protections. 20,000 gold. You like?~

@567890 = ~I spy a ring clinking on your finger! Too many rings for youse fingers? Is big problem, Cespenar know. Soo many sparklies, so few claws.~ [FWCESP39]
@5678990 = ~Tell you what. Cespenar can merge together your rings of Wizardy and Acuity, along with old-forgotten Metaspell Amulet and standard Ring of Protection to form Sorcerian Ring. Very nice for the mages. You like, for 20,000 gold?~

@567892 = ~Can you improve on this girdle?~

@567893 = ~Ooh, belts are quite the fashion this season. Wonder why all of these look sort of beige? Must be this horrid pocket-plane lighting. Always make Cespenar look tired.~ [FWCESP40]
// @5678993 = ~Anyway, if youse have three belts of protection, I have recipe for combining them into one really thick belt. If you hide behind it, enemies cannot hurt you. Such a deal. You like, for 10,000 gold?~
@56789993 = ~Anyway, if youse have three belts of protection, I have recipe for combining them into one really thick belt. If you hide behind it, enemies cannot hurt you. Such a deal, but need three bloodstones all of same type. You like, for 10,000 gold?~

@567895 = ~Might you upgrade this Black Spider Figurine?~
@567896 = ~Ooh, sneaky-sneaky! You want Cespenar to make your friendly neighborhood spider figurine more amazing? Add some web spinners, maybe? You want to terrorize a certain goblin?~ [FWCESP41]
@5678996 = ~Cesepnar's senses are tingling at the thought. However, need special materials to upgrade this wall-crawler. Must have scrolls of Spider Spawn and Web, plus five poisoned throwing daggers. Also 5,000 gold. You want?~

@567897 = ~Can Chaos and Entropy be improved?~
@567898 = ~Short swords? Takes secure guy to use short swords, if you catch Cespenar's drift. But need more thwacking power, eh? Okay, here's what Cespenar can do. Get bewilderment scroll and malison scroll, mix with Ilbratha and Arbane, and short swords will be even more worthy of being called Abyssal Weapons! Oh, Cespenar also needs 25,000 gold. And a Rogue stone, unless you want to be picking up pieces of Cespenar all over pocket plane. Um, that not suggestion.~ [FWCESP42]

@567899 = ~Can you forge me some elven chain?~
@5678100 = ~Oooh Yes! You likes things hot and spicy? Cespenar stir-fry together some elven chain with some red dragon scales. Add shiitake mushrooms, some andar spices and fire agate peppers and presto: very light, very hot, very filling. Cespenar quite the iron chef ... or perhaps the culinary forger. Unfortunately, special wok and peanut oil will set you back 25,000 gold. You still want?~ [FWCESP43]
