        Section I. About
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Item Upgrade Mod Pack allows Cromwell and Cespenar to upgrade more
items for you. Half of them are conveniences, the other half try to prop up
weapon categories that are "weak" by comparison (e.g., maces and clubs).

See Section III for an item list.


        Section II. Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII is required. ToB is optional but recommended. The Item Upgrade Mod
will install correctly over (or without) the Ascension Mod. It should work
fine with any WeiDU mod. See the webpage for details.

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-ItemUpgrade.exe".

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available:
  American English

  German Translation by Maus (maus@fphfslinux.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de)

  Russian Translation by Iogan
                     & AERIE.RU
  Korean Translation by web2air

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "Setup-ItemUpgrade.exe".

Starting from v38, there are 2 sub-components for both SoA and ToB components:

1) Original Version: This is Wes Weimer's original item upgrade mod where
                     you can actually *tell* Cromwell and/or Cespenar through
                     dialogue about what to upgrade.

2) Revised Consistency-plus version: In order to bring the upgrades more
                     in-line with how vanilla Crom/Cespy upgrades happen
                     (they rummage through your stuff and tell you what they
                     can do with the items) this component lets Crom and Cespy
                     find what they can work with without you specifying. Like
                     vanilla, you can still tell them to ignore the item if you
                     want :)

You do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything you
installed.

The components should install correctly for international players who have
both DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK.


        Section III. Items
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The items are listed here with the components on the left and the result on
the right. For example, the first group means that you can forge a Ring of
Protection +1, a Ring of Regeneration, a Diamond and 10,000 gold into a Ring
of Preservation +1.

[ This mod also fixes Carsomyr +5 and Carsomyr +6 so that they use the same
  "dispel magic" opcode as the Staff of the Magi. That is, they will
  actually dispel things. They also increase MR by 50% rather than setting
  it to 50%. In addition, the Mace of Disruption +2 now uses the MoD+1 icon. ]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING! Do not use ShadowKeeper to give yourself the components for an
upgrade and then complain that Cromwell and Cespy won't let you do the
upgrade. ShadowKeeper will often list multiple entries for an item (e.g.,
there are two "Pearl"s and two "Wand of Lightning"s in ShadowKeeper's item
list) -- but only one of them is really found in the game and only one of
them will work with the Item Upgrade mod. If you give yourself the wrong
one (and it is easy to do since they have the same name) you won't be able
to do the upgrade.


        Section IV. Known Bugs
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently none of the items count as "magical items" or "magical armor", so
you may wear them and rings of protection at the same time.

Cespenar can sometimes "drop reagents". You will still get your upgrade,
but you might get some of the gems back or something.

(Revised component only) Because BG2Tweaks adds 2 (interchangeable) versions
of all protection items (ring, amulet & cloak), the upgrade recipes for the
Amulet of ilmatar and the Gloves of Master Thief require 2 of the SAME
versions of the item to be detected. Detecting all combinations is possible
(but tedious) so may be implemented in the future.

        Section V. Thanks
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special thanks to Jason Compton for the Cespenar dialogue. Thanks to GB for
testing the ITM files.

Thanks to Artemidore for the French translation!

Thanks to Maus for the German translation!

And a big "thank you" to all of the people on alt.games.baldurs-gate who
answered my survey. The items were balanced according to your
specifications.


        Section V. FAQ (Spoilers)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: Why can't I talk to Lilarcor?

A: Lilarcor +5 is controlled by the mind flayer circlet and thus prevented
from having complete conversations. He will still banter with you (e.g.,
"Booring!" or "Throw a coin in that fountain!") while you're standing
around.


Q: Does the Ring of Elemental Mastery include the "hidden" +1 saves
bonus from the Ring of Earth Control?

A: Yes. The "hidden" +1 saves bonus in the Earth Control ring may or may
not be a bug in BG2, but by a large margin users voted to keep the +1
bonus in the RoEM regardless.


Q: How do I get that many demon hearts?

A: There are three in the Mage Stronghold Quest (the Planar Sphere) and you
only need to give one back to the Sphere to get out. That leaves you with
two spares. You may also use the demon hearts from the maze level of the
Watcher's Keep. That will leave you with 0 to 2 spares.


Q: Where can I get a cursed potion of healing?

A: Nearly every merchant in Athkatla sells the things. Look for the bottle
labeled "Potion of Healing" that isn't blue. The description usually says
something about it being "oddly murky".


Q: What are the stats for the original Kitthix?

A: 44 HP, Base AC 4, Attacks 3/2, Saves 12/14/13/14/14, 10% MR, 2 Hit Dice,
14 STR, 9 Other Stats. Attack: +0 weapon, 1d8 piercing, save vs. poison at
+1 or take 3 hp per second for 14 seconds. Immune to Web.


Q: What are the stats for the Improved Kitthix?

A: 80 HP, Base AC -2, 4 Attacks, Saves 6, 25% MR, 10 Hit Dice, 18 DEX.
Attack: +3 weapon, 2d4 piercing, save vs. poison at -3 or take 5 hp per
second for 12 seconds, save vs. spells at -2 or be webbed for 7 seconds.
Immunity to Web, 50% melee damage resistance. Regenerates.


Q: Where is Water's Edge?

A: It belongs to a noble drow in the city of Ust Natha. Do all of the
side-quests there.

Version 5:
    * Big Cespy dialogue from Jason Compton, master of BGII humor.
    * Require Contingency scrolls instead of Chain Contingency (forum
      suggestion).
    * Require 2 elven holy water instead of 3 (you can still use one on
      Bodhi, even though you don't really need it).
    * Fixed Ring-Mastery fire-res bug.
    * Fixed a bug where you'd get the wrong boots back.
    * OK, talking Lilarcor by popular demand. You can't "converse" with
      him, but he'll still banter every once in a while.
    * Daystar upgrade now really only takes 2 vials of holy water.
      Thanks to Jason Whittaker.
    * Cromwell spelling fixes by Necardan.
    * The lovely CF description from Homunculus has been included.

      those demon hearts from the Watcher's Keep.

      identifying this problem.

    * Added the Holy Buckler and Thief Glove upgrades based on user
      suggestions.

      This might actually make it worthwhile to cast the Gate spell,

Version 25:
    * More French translations from Cocobard.
    * More German translations from Norbert Frischauf.

    * Cromwell and Cespenar dialogues no longer replace critical states,
      making it much easier for other mods to interact with IU
    * Fixed broken index for c2blun02.itm. On OS X, a bad index causes

      via patch instead of overwrite
    * Lilarcor +5, like the original, was permanently setting an

      Fixpack.
