On another note, I've been pondering the Item Upgrade README and the TODO
list, and will be compiling some fun suggestions. One of my favorites is,
"Why the *HELL* does Cromwell need TWO HUNDRED POUNDS of illithium to apply
a thin plating to an EIGHT-POUND MACE???"  And I intone a rousing "Hear,
hear!" to the guy who suggested making the MOD+2 look like the MOD+1. Been
wanting to do that myself.


upgrade Dak'kon's Zerth Blade

force mace of disruption +2 to keep it's old icon and picture in item
description

Give Cespy the Horn of Valhalla upgrades. 

Since blackrazor is essentially an extention of the bhaal essense,
shouldn't it increase in power as well? My recommendation is at minimum a
+5 dmg and to-hit black razor with the original abilities unchanged,

Improved Blade of Roses
made from Blade of Roses, Ring of Human Influence, Nymph's Cloak, 5
Bloodstone Gems and 20.000 gold
still +3
set's charisma to 25


combine helm of glory and brilliance

scimitars! (belm + arbane?) (water's edge + equalizer?)

bracer combos: defense + blinding strike? 

Let Crom do WK-related upgrades (e.g., White Dragon Armor). 

upgrade the sword of balduran

reduced casting time for archmagi?

gauntlets of crushing + monk bracers in tob

Hi Wes:

I have a few suggestions for the item upgrade mod.

TENSER'S PLATE MAIL:

b) Scroll of Tenser's Transformation  
c) Scroll of Strength  
d) Scroll of Improved Haste
e) 5,000 gold      
             Armor Class = 2

             Tenser's Transformation (2x/day)
             Improved Haste (2x/day)
             Strength set 18/00   
             Useable by all classes

a) Mage robe of Cold Resistance
b) Mage robe of Fire Resistance  
c) Mage Robe of Electric Resistance  
d) Knave's Robe

             +2 to Armor Class
             +2 to saving throws
             +20% fire/cold/electric resistance
             Useable only by magic users

Let me know what you think.

The first is one I would really like to see: the upgraded D'akkon Blade!
I always take it for my fighter/mages till the end IN ANY CASE, maybe
a little boost wouldn't harm...

Something like:
-2 to AC (instead of -1)
+3 enchanted (instead of +2)
Additional 5th level spell memorized (they were one for the each of the
levels
1-4)

As components.. hmm
Potions of Genius?
The Malakar Katana? (AC -2 vs slashing)
Usual gems and/or gold...


* More NPC-specific items: there's not many more that would need to be
included to give everyone that starts with interesting things an upgrade.
Nalia's ring maybe, but some of Jan's stuff definitely. Require Festule
the Alchemist's potion?

* Better stronghold quest rewards: The Night's Gift. Ardulia's Fall. SS of
Backstabbing (now Mae'var's hard enough that you can't get it easily).
Given how much you need to do to get these items, it'd be nice to have
some way of making them remain useful. (The mace in particular needs this:
if it's possible, it'd be nice to have the upgrade in different versions
depending on the temple you did the quest for, or something... so that if
you're a cleric, the weapon you got from your stronghold quest is one
you're likely to use for some time.)

* Early upgrades: this is a bit of a tricky one, but it'd be interesting
to have less powerful upgrades available before Ch4. The problem, I
suppose, is making them still useful. The above mace upgrade might work
here, I think, if it gave you something like a mace +3, say with one
moderate resistance and a 1/day ability of some kind.

* Gems: More gems = good. In my current game, the most difficulty I'm
having getting upgrade components is the five sunstones for the Amaunator
buckler. They don't seem to be guaranteed anywhere... recipes involving
significant numbers of the lower value gemstones - possibly these could
offer early-game upgrades, I suppose - make these items more interesting
and less of "there goes another inventory slot, why can't they just carry
coins?". IYSWIM.

* More left-over quest items?: They're starting to look a bit thin on the
ground :) The shadow dragon wardstone comes to mind - confer NPP on the
shadow dragon armour perhaps, or enhance acid resistance? Then there's
Kurtulmak's crystal shard (which *has* to be good for something) and
Dace's hand (which might not be). (I suppose a recipe requiring all the
Baalor Ale in the game is out of the question? :) )

There's a number of dragons in the game and most of them have scales you
can scavenge. Why not give some of the other dragons some scavengable
scales (either by script or .cre editing) You could make more armours up
and you could also make up the logical conclusion: We have in SOA Black,
Red, Shadow, Silver dragons and one in Hell which I'm not sure about -
probably Red but I don't know. Watcher's Keep has some white scales and Red
& Green Dragons. Lastly, TOB has a Brown and a Blue. (there's also a purple
if we're using Improved Abazigal) Why not make a suit of Chromatic Armour
using the traditional Black, White, Red, Blue and Green Scales (or armours
made from these) As the only Blue is Abazigal it'd be a while before we got
the potential for this, but it'd be worth it yes? Note, Black dragons
should provide acid resistance, Shadow dragons should provide negative
plane protection - a gripe about the armour provided by the designers.

I have some more suggestions for item upgrades:

GAUNTLETS OF POWER:
a) Bracers of Archery

                   +3 THACO / +6 damage       
                   Grand Mastery in Quarterstaffs
                   Spell Deflection 2/day
                   Resurrection 2/day
                   useable only by Clerics or Druids

TORGAL'S BLADE:
a) Wakizashi +1
b) Ninja-To +1
c) Scimitar +1
d) Torgal's Claw (require improved Torgal mod)
e) 5  iol gems
f) 10,000 gold
                   +4 THACO Wakizashi/Nija-to/Scimitar
                   old Torgal's Claw damage and powers
                  
BLADE OF BALDURAN:
a) Sword of Balduran (bonus merchants)
b) Blade of Roses (Copper Coronet)
c) Sword of Flame (Copper Coronet)
d) Scroll of Fireball

                   +4 THACO/ +4 damage long sword
                   +10% Magic Resistance
                   +10% Lore
                   +2 to CHA
                   +5 fire damage each hit

     I also noticed that it makes the Amulet of Power
     usable by Paladins and Rangers, and NOT usable by Monks.
     This is a realistic step, as Monks can't cast spells,
     but it leaves Monks, especially Solo Monks, with no way
     of protecting themselves from Vampires. Are you thinking
     of creating an item that Monks can use, that grants
     Negative Plane Protection?
